Based on the available information of clinical parameters of patients, I have tried to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not.

The original data came from :
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease 

Another version of the data is available at kaggle :
https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

I targeted an accuracy of atleast 95% in predicting whether a patient has heart disease or not. However, my model has an accuracy of 88%.
